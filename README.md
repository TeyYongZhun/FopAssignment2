# Assignment2 for the FOP
# University Course Registration System 🎓

A University Course Registration System built from scratch, demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This project simulates a real-world scenario where students can manage their course enrollments while adhering to system constraints.

## 📺 Video Demo
**(https://youtu.be/AtsztjnoY_E?si=Y6TJrLhMH7_2ZTwM)**

In this video, we cover:
* Building the system structure.
* Explanation of OOP concepts used (Composition, Encapsulation, Constructor Chaining).
* Demonstration of validation logic.

## ✨ Project Features
* **Core Classes**: Dedicated classes for `Student`, `Course`, and `Registration`.
* **Course Management**: Methods to **enroll**, **drop**, and **view** registered courses.
* **Validation Logic**: Implemented robust checks to validate:
    * Course capacity limits.
    * Prerequisites before enrollment.

## 🛠 Key OOP Concepts
This project focuses on the practical application of:
* **Composition**: Building complex objects from simpler ones.
* **Encapsulation**: Protecting data integrity through private fields and public accessors.
* **Constructor Chaining**: Efficiently initializing objects with varying levels of detail.
